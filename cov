The Supervisor Binary Interface(SBI) specification[1] now defines a
base extension that provides extendability to add future extensions
while maintaining backward compatibility with previous versions.
The new version is defined as 0.2 and older version is marked as 0.1.

This series adds following features to RISC-V Linux.
1. Adds support for SBI v0.2
2. A Unified calling convention implementation between 0.1 and 0.2. 
3. SBI Hart state management extension (HSM)
4. Ordered booting of harts
4. CPU hotplug 

Dependencies:
The support for SBI v0.2 and HSM extension is already available in OpenSBI
master.
